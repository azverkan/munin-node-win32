munin-node - agent for windows. 

Yet another fork of the origional munin-node-win32 agent. Munin Node for Windows is a Windows client for the Munin monitoring system.It is written in C++ with most plugins built into the executable.

The lineage is like this. 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/munin-nodewin32/ -> http://code.google.com/p/munin-node-win32/ -> http://github.com/joshrobb/munin-node-win32

I've chosen to put this on github - because at least forking is easy here - and pull requests are even easier. 

New Features
* support DERIVE types for perfmon counters.
* turn of verbose event log logging (controled via [MuninNode] DebugLog=true/false)
